# Developing Applications with the Microsoft Identity Platform

If you are looking to connect your modern applications to the Microsoft Identity Platform, specifically utilizing Azure Active Directory and the Microsoft Graph, then this webinar series is for you. You will learn the fundamentals of registering new applications and then how to send users to authenticate to Azure AD, both manually and using the latest developer SDKs. 

The Microsoft Identity Platform unifies the way we develop solutions that integrate to Azure AD in a simple to understand and streamlined way. Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. This series will take you from the absolute fundamentals through building sophisticated applications that connect to Azure services or the Microsoft Graph.
